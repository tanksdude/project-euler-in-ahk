# Project Euler Solutions in AutoHotkey

Solutions to a few problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives), written in AutoHotkey.

## "Why are you doing this in AutoHotkey?"

Um... because I think it's funny solving these problems in AHK. That's it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* AutoHotkey installed
* Literally nothing better to do in life than go through solutions to Project Euler problems written in AHK
    * seriously, have you nothing better to do?

### Installation

* download a `.ahk` file of your choosing

### Building (Windows)

AHK is a scripting language, so just run the script. (Note: AHK is Windows-only.)

Warning: each script puts the answer on the clipboard (and also displays a message), so make sure you don't have important stuff on your clipboard before running a script.

## PROJECT EULER NOTICE

Project Euler recommends you solve the problems yourself, because looking up the solutions doesn't make you learn anything. I have some solutions here because AHK isn't really intended for math problems, and I want to share solving these problems in a restrictive language.

## Contributing

I'm by no means requiring you to contribute (or even asking), but if you want to add some solutions I'll consider it.
