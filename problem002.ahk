; Project Euler Problem #2

; Problem #2 text:
; Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will
; be:
; 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
; By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

; code
#SingleInstance

NUM := 4000000
answer := 2 ; initialize to 2 because the loop starts at fib(3)

prevNumberA := 1
prevNumberB := 2
newFib := 3

while (newFib <= NUM)
{
	if (Mod(newFib, 2) == 0) {
		answer := answer + newFib
	}
	prevNumberA := prevNumberB
	prevNumberB := newFib
	newFib := prevNumberA + prevNumberB
